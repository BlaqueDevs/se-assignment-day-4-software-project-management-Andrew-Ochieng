|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Approach**           | Iterative and incremental                                                 | Linear and sequential                                                  |
| **Flexibility**        | High; adapts to changes easily                                            | Low; changes are difficult once the project starts                     |
| **Client Involvement** | Continuous collaboration with clients                                     | Limited client involvement after requirements are defined              |
| **Delivery**           | Frequent deliverables (sprints)                                           | Single delivery at the end of the project                              |
| **Risk Management**    | Risks are identified and addressed early                                  | Risks may only become apparent late in the project                     |
| **Best For**           | Projects with evolving requirements (e.g., startups, innovative products) | Projects with well-defined requirements (e.g., regulatory compliance)  |

### Advantages and Disadvantages
- **Agile:**
  - *Advantages:* Adaptable, early delivery, improved collaboration.
  - *Disadvantages:* Requires experienced teams, lacks documentation.
